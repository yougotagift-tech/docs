### Changes
The goal of RestAPI v1 is to support global gifts which requires additional details for redemption. Eg: Code, Redemption URL, PIN etc..

### Summary of changes
* Removed "pdf_link" since "gift_pdf_link" has been introduced in 0.4 to provide an direct gift pdf download link.
* Removed "excel_link" since this functionality is currently not used by any user. Might introduce later when the need arises.
* "gift_voucher" has been introduced to provide all the important details required to redeem a gift in a single field.

### How It Works

The YouGotaGift.com Corporate Rewards API is an HTTP API, you can call it with simple HTTP GET/POST, and the result will be in JSON.

### API Endpoints

* All the API points return JSON responses.
* All the API points are callable using HTTP methods, some will only accept `GET` requests, some will only accept `POST` requests, and some will accept both.
* Authentication is done using HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS secured channel in HTTPS.
* The HTTP Response Code will tell you whether your call was successful or not.
* `HTTP 200` Means everything went okay.
