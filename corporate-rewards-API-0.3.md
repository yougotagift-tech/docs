## Overview

This is a documentation of the YouGotaGift.com Corporate Rewards API.

### API Latest Version Link
[Latest Version](https://github.com/YouGotaGift/docs/blob/master/Corporate-Rewards-API.md)

### Changes
Removed "quantity" option, since the goal of the API is to issue one Gift per order, bulk ordering is being taken care in a different method. And more than one quantity on a single request is not being supported by many newly launched brands. After analysing some more data, we came to a conclusion to remove the "quantity" option

### How It Works

The YouGotaGift.com Corporate Rewards API is an HTTP API, you can call it with simple HTTP GET/POST, and the result will be in JSON.

### API Endpoints
* All the following API endpoints are available under `https://yougotagift.com/corporate/api/`.
* All the API points return JSON responses.
* All the API points are callable using HTTP methods, some will only accept `GET` requests, some will only accept `POST` requests, and some will accept both.
* Authentication is done using HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS secured channel in HTTPS.
* The HTTP Response Code will tell you whether your call was successful or not.
* `HTTP 200` Means everything went okay.
* `HTTP 404` Means the object you were accessing does not exist.
* `HTTP 400` Means that you have an error in your request, the JSON content will have `errors` field which will explain what is the issue.
* `HTTP 500` Oops, it's our fault, we'll solve it ASAP.
